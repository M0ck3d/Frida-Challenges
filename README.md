# Vulnerable WebViews Project

## Overview

The Vulnerable WebViews Project is an educational initiative aimed at raising awareness about security vulnerabilities associated with the usage of WebViews in mobile applications. WebViews are commonly used to embed web content within native mobile apps, providing a seamless way to integrate web-based functionality. However, improper implementation and configuration of WebViews can lead to significant security risks.

This project provides a collection of sample mobile applications with intentionally introduced vulnerabilities in their WebViews. By studying these vulnerabilities, developers, security enthusiasts, and researchers can better understand the potential risks and learn how to secure their apps effectively.
